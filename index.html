            <img src="img/wow.png" alt=""><p class="happy">Every day we see and meet people who look happy from the outside but deep down they are broken and are sad from the inside. For many people, money is the main cause of happiness or grief. But this is not right. Money can buy you food, luxurious house, healthy lifestyle servants, and many more facilities but money can’t buy you happiness.

                And if money can buy happiness then the rich would be the happiest person on the earth. But, we see a contrary image of the rich as they are sad, fearful, anxious, stressed, and suffering from various problems.
                
                In addition, they have money still they lack in social life with their family especially their wives and this is the main cause of divorce among them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container2">
            <img class="photo" src="img/sad.png" alt=""><p class="sad">Sadness is an emotion that has a bad reputation in our society and is often categorized as weakness or depression. In the film, Inside Out, it shows its viewers what is happening in the mind of an 11-year-old girl, Riley. At the beginning of the film, Joy admits that she doesn’t understand what Sadness is for or why it’s even in Riley’s head when sadness is introduced. At one point in life, many of us have probably questioned the purpose of sadness and why we need it because it makes us feel terrible</p>

        <div class="container3">
            <img src="img/now.png" alt=""><p class="now">There seems to be a widespread presumption that writing is prescriptive (or proscriptive) rather than simply observational or meditative. Some people condemn or commend even memoirs and novels as though their purpose were to instruct or offer models. I suppose I can’t entirely fault readers for this misapprehension. Confident authority is an appropriate tone for straight reportage, but it’s become the default of columnists, essayists and bloggers, one that’s so reflexive that some of them seem to forget it’s a pose. To some extent this is a deformative effect of the space restrictions within which most of us work; in a thousand-word essay you can’t include every qualification or second thought that occurs to you or you’d expend your allotted space refuting your own argument instead of making it.</p>

        <div class="container4">
            <img class="panic" src="img/hhy.png" alt=""><p class="www">Anic attacks can occur in any anxiety situation associated with the underlying cause of the disorder (for example, a person with a snake phobia may panic at the sight of a snake). Such panic attacks are called "expected". "Unexpected" are those panic attacks that occur spontaneously without any apparent reason.Most people with panic disorder anticipate another attack and avoid places or situations in which they previously panicked. People with panic disorder often worry that they have dangerous heart, lung, brain, or other disorders, and they repeatedly visit their family doctor or go to the emergency room for help. Unfortunately, in these settings, attention is often focused on general medical symptoms, and the correct diagnosis is not made.</p>
